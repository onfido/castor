# Theming

Castor comes with two pre-built themes, `day` and `night`.

They are designed to align with device specific light/dark modes.

Unlike components, theming is just as equally efficient regardless of your
choice of Sass or CSS.

### Sass

```css dark
@use '@onfido/castor';

:root {
  @include castor.day();
}
```

### HTML + CSS

```html dark
<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@onfido/castor/dist/themes/day.css" />
```

### JS / TS

```js dark
import '@onfido/castor/dist/themes/day.css';
```

## Multiple themes

If you want to provide multiple themes, Castor offers the "class" variant of
each theme, and helpers to make using them easier.

That means that no theme applies to the whole page by default anymore, and you
will need to explicitly define the current one.

Also, there's still one efficiency concern: all themes define "base" tokens, so
after one has defined them, the next theme does not need to.

Again, only Sass will be able to optimise that, except PurgeCSS doesn't help here.

### Sass

For efficiency, include Castor's base tokens only once, then the "raw" variants
of each theme you want to provide.

Themes also need to be "class" in this case otherwise the last one defined would
simply override all previous themes.

```css dark
@use '@onfido/castor';

:root {
  @include castor.tokens();
}

@include castor.day('class', 'raw');
@include castor.night('class', 'raw');
```

Then, you explicitly define the theme by applying its class to your theming
container (usually the root element of your app).

You can more easily apply and switch between themes with our JS helper, see the
following section.

```html dark
<body class="castor-theme--day"></body>
```

### JS / TS

Import the "class" variants of each theme to be able to switch between them:

```js dark
import '@onfido/castor/dist/themes/day-class.css';
import '@onfido/castor/dist/themes/night-class.css';
```

Then, you can explicitly define the theme by applying its class to your theming
container (usually the root element of your app).

```html dark
<body class="castor-theme--day"></body>
```

Or you can use the provided helper.

```js dark
import { switchTheme } from '@onfido/castor';

switchTheme('day');
// second argument specifies the element, defaults to document.body
switchTheme('night', document.querySelector('#root'));
```

## Creating a custom theme

> Sass only, CSS is possible but not documented or officially supported

Castor components use theme tokens for styling.

Most of the time theme tokens will reference base tokens, but they can also have
static values. Colors may have an alpha/opacity value defined in either
approach.

When creating a new theme, each theme token must be defined.

The easiest way would be to extend one of Castor's themes, for instance "day"
theme, and then overriding some theme tokens:

> Color tokens must be valid
> [rgba()](<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/rgba()>)
> values

```css dark
@use '@onfido/castor';

/* .castor-theme--custom-day */
@include castor.theme('custom-day', 'class') {
  @include castor.day();

  /* override theme color with palette token */
  --ods-color-content-main: var(--ods-color-primary-800), 1;
  /* override theme color with static value */
  --ods-color-content-secondary: 136, 136, 136, 0.8;
  /* override palette color */
  --ods-color-primary-500: 255, 20, 147;
}
```

To ensure the theme switching helper works properly, the class name of any theme
must be start with `castor-theme--` followed by one or more characters that
identify a unique theme.

We recommend using the `castor.theme()` mixin as showed above, which applies the
prefix automatically - first argument is a mandatory theme name.

Additionally it accepts optional string arguments (order does not matter):

- `class` - wraps theme tokens within a CSS class
- `raw` - excludes base tokens, leaving only theme tokens in the output

For example:

```css dark
@include castor.theme('my-theme', 'raw', 'class');
```

## CSS specificity

Castor is currently not locked at `0-1-0`
[specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity),
so overriding or customising CSS rules need greater care.

We want to have all rules at `0-1-0` though so we keep an eye on
[:where()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:where)
browser support and will refactor Castor when it's more generally available.

That is because our main goal was to make our API easy and terse for developers,
so we use an adapted [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction) strategy that enables
that, while still avoiding most class name clashes.

For example, `.ods-button.-action--primary:disabled` has `0-3-0` specificity.

- `ods-` is our prefix (Onfido Design System) for uniqueness
- `button` is the name of the Component
- `-action--primary` is a component Modifier
  - `-` a prefix for all modifiers
  - `--` joins modifier words that are compound state (action + primary)
- some modifiers are pseudo-states (`:disabled`, `:hover`)

In order to modify styles for components, simply overriding the base CSS rules
might not be sufficient.

For simplicity, let's focus on Button's `color`:

```css dark
/* from Castor */
.ods-button.-action--primary {
  color: rgba(var(--ods-color-content-on-action));
}
.ods-button:disabled {
  color: rgba(var(--ods-color-content-disabled));
}

/* custom */
.ods-button.-action--primary {
  color: rgba(var(--my-own-variable));
}
```

In that scenario, a Button of kind "action" and variant "primary" would
successfully have its color overriden.

However, a `:disabled` button would as well, unintentionally.

That is because the specificity of all those rules is the same, `0-2-0`, so the
one defined last wins.

Which is why we recommend overriding only the values of CSS variables in order
to customise Castor.

```css dark
/* custom */
.ods-button {
  --ods-color-content-on-action: var(--my-own-variable);
}
```

That way, the `:disabled` color would still apply properly.

Still, creating your own custom theme that applies globally to `:root` is still
the best way to make sure your styles are consistent across components.

Only override component specific styles if there's a good reason to do so.
