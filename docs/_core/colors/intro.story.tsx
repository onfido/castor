      Colors are used to create contrast and highlight key elements or actions

      We recommend accessing tokens via the helpers provided. However, you may
      use them directly, e.g. on CSS:
    </p>
    <Source
      language="css"
      code={`
        .text {
          color: var(--color-content-main);
        }
      `}
      format
      dark
    />
  </>
);
