# Castor

is [Onfido](https://onfido.com)'s open source design system.

It's been designed for the **whole web**, which means you can use Castor however
you fancy, be it with **React**, **Vue**, **Ruby on Rails**, or simply
old-school vanilla **HTML** and **CSS**.

We also offer integration packages that offer idiomatic enhancement on top,
currently that's only **React** (most used internally at Onfido), but we intend
to expand to [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) soon after.

We're currently focused on building core components (CSS and React) and on
improving documentation.

### Bits and pieces

- `@onfido/castor` is our core package, it has all the base CSS definitions,
  Sass mixins and TypeScript types and helper functions
- `@onfido/castor-icons` offers iconography assets, mostly `.svg`
- `@onfido/castor-react` is our React specific package, it offers idiomatic
  integration via Components and hooks
- `@onfido/castor-tokens` is where all of our design tokens live. They are the
  base layer for all targets (web and mobile) and are automatically generated
  from a single definition. **You don't need to install it manually**

# Getting started

We recommend using your favourite node package manager to install it locally:

```bash dark
npm i @onfido/castor
```

Doing so will ensure your build tools can optimise the output of your
application.

Also install `icons` and/or `react` if you plan to use either:

```bash dark
npm i @onfido/castor-icons @onfido/castor-react
```

Then import each function or component you'd like to use:

```tsx dark
import { Button } from '@onfido/castor-react';

<Button>Hello world!</Button>;
```

Castor is coded in TypeScript, so if you have a code editor that supports its
syntax, exploring Castor's API inline is the best and fastest way to learn it.

Otherwise, components and helper functions are documented here in Storybook and
in our main website.

## Prototyping quickstart

You can also use the faster but more inefficient remote import from `npm`
mirrors such as `jsdeliver` or `skypack`.

**Doing so is not recommended for production systems.**

You can import it as an ES module:

```html dark
<script type="module">
  import { color } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/@onfido/castor';
  import { Button } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/@onfido/castor-react';
</script>
```

Or you can import the `prototype.js` file which exposes a global variable
`Castor` (only available for `react`)

```html dark
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@onfido/castor-react/prototype.min.js"></script>
<script>
  const { Button } = Castor;
</script>
```
