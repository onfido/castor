# Castor

is [Onfido](https://onfido.com)'s open source design system.

It's been designed for the **whole web**, which means you can use Castor however
you fancy, be it with **React**, **Vue**, **Ruby on Rails**, or simply
old-school vanilla **HTML** and **CSS**.

We also offer integration packages that offer idiomatic enhancement on top,
currently that's only **React** (most used internally at Onfido), but we intend
to expand to
[Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components)
soon after.

We're currently focused on building core components (CSS and React) and on
improving documentation.

---

### Bits and pieces

- `@onfido/castor` is our core package, it has all the base CSS definitions,
  Sass mixins and TypeScript types and helper functions
- `@onfido/castor-icons` offers iconography assets, mostly `.svg`
- `@onfido/castor-react` is our React specific package, it offers idiomatic
  integration via Components and hooks
- `@onfido/castor-tokens` is where all of our design tokens live. They are the
  base layer for all targets (web and mobile) and are automatically generated
  from a single definition. **You don't need to install it manually**

# Getting started

## Installing

We recommend using your favourite node package manager to install it locally:

```bash dark
npm i @onfido/castor
```

Doing so will ensure your build tools can optimise the output of your
application.

Also install `icons` and/or `react` if you plan to use either:

```bash dark
npm i @onfido/castor-icons @onfido/castor-react
```

Castor is coded in TypeScript, so if you have a code editor that supports its
syntax, exploring Castor's API inline is the best and fastest way to learn it.

Otherwise, components and helper functions are documented here in Storybook and
in our main website.

## Styles

First you will need to add Castor's component styles to your page.

That can be done more efficiently with [Sass](https://sass-lang.com), or more
easily with CSS.

Then you will need to [pick a theme](/docs/theming--page), or
[build your own](/docs/theming--page#creating-a-custom-theme).

### Sass (more efficient)

Thanks to mixins and having a build step, by using [Sass](https://sass-lang.com)
you can omit components that you're not using from the final CSS.

It's the best choice if your app is sensitive to performance, size and load
times.

> A similar result can be accomplished with [PurgeCSS](https://purgecss.com)
> if you don't want to use Sass but requires more intricate setup.

```css dark
@use '@onfido/castor';

// will only output CSS for components included
@include castor.Button();
@include castor.Icon();
```

Alternatively you can include all components at once.

```css dark
// not recommended for production
@include castor.components();
```

### CSS (easier)

If you can't or won't use [Sass](https://sass-lang.com), there are also
pre-built CSS files including all components.

> We recommend using a tool such as [PurgeCSS](https://purgecss.com) in order to
> remove unused styles from your final build.

You can link them from HTML:

```html dark
<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@onfido/castor/dist/core.css" />
```

Or import from JS/TS if your bundler supports it:

```js dark
import '@onfido/castor/dist/core.css';
```

## Components

As stated before, currently only React has our more complete and intended API
for components.

See [how to get started with React](/docs/react-intro--page).

If you can't use React, until we have Web Components you will have to use the
[CSS classes](/docs/css-intro--page) and bind state with JS/TS of your own.

## Prototyping quickstart

You can also start quicker with a more inefficient remote import from `npm`
mirrors such as `jsdeliver` or `skypack`.

**Doing so is not recommended for production systems.**

You can import it as an ES module:

```html dark
<script type="module">
  import { color } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/@onfido/castor';
  import { Button } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/@onfido/castor-react';
</script>
```

Or you can import the `prototype.js` file which exposes a global variable
`Castor` (only available for `react`)

```html dark
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@onfido/castor-react/prototype.min.js"></script>
<script>
  const { Button } = Castor;
</script>
```
