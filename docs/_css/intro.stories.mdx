# Vanilla HTML + CSS

is Castor's lowest level API.

Ideal in case you are not using React, or need more flexibility than what its
components offer.

```html dark
<button class="ods-button -action--primary">Hello world!</button>
```

### CSS specificity

Castor is currently not locked at `0-1-0` specificity, so overriding or
customising CSS rules need greater care.

We keep an eye on [:where()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:where)
browser support and will refactor Castor when it's more generally available.

For class names we use an adapted [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction) strategy
that makes the API easier and terser for developers, while still avoiding most
name clashes.

- `ods-` is our prefix (Onfido Design System) for uniqueness
- `button` is the name of the Component
- `-action--primary` is a component Modifier
  - `-` a prefix for all modifiers
  - `--` joins modifier words that are compound state (action + primary)
- some modifiers are pseudo-states (`:disabled`, `:hover`)
