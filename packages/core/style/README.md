These files are only used during build to generate static `.css` files.

They are meant to be used like so:

`index.html`

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="@onfido/castor/dist/castor.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="@onfido/castor/dist/themes/day.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="@onfido/castor/dist/themes/night.css" />
```
